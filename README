This directory contains  the PSBLAS library, version 2.1.1

 
Version 1.0 of the library was described in:
S. Filippone, M. Colajanni
PSBLAS: A library for parallel linear algebra computation on sparse matrices
ACM Trans. on Math. Software, 26(4), Dec. 2000, pp. 527-550.

PLATFORMS: 

The compilation process relies on the choice of an appropriate
Make.inc file; we have tested with AIX XLF, Intel ifort/Linux,  Nag
f95/Linux, GNU Fortran/Linux, Sun Forte 6.2. If you succeed in
compiling with  other compiler/operating systems please let us know. 


LINUX:

On Linux we work with the GCC compiler; note that we require version
4.2.0 (or later) as it contains support for ALLOCATABLEs (as
specified  in TR15581). 

For the Intel compilers, we recommend version 9.1 or later; previous
versions of the library have been compiled with version 7 and 8 of
ifort. 

IBM SP.
The library has been tested on an IBM SP5, with XLC and XLF 
version 10.1 and the IBM ESSL/PESSL versions of the BLAS and the
BLACS. 
The  setting 
 F90=xlf90 -qsuffix=f=f90
in Make.inc.sp5 takes care of the f90 extension. 


UTILITIES
The test/util directory contains some utilities to convert to/from
Harwell-Boeing and MatrixMarket file formats. 


DOCUMENTATION

See userguide.pdf 
Please consult the sample programs, especially test/pargen/ppde90.f90. 


OTHER SOFTWARE CREDITS 

We include our modified implementation of some of the Sparker (serial
sparse BLAS)  material,  e.g. Jagged diagonal, plus a number of
extensions of our own design. The original file spblas.f can be
downloaded from matisa.cc.rl.ac.uk; of course any bugs in our
implementation are our own to fix.  The main reference for the serial
sparse BLAS is: 
Duff, I., Marrone, M., Radicati, G., and Vittoli, C.
Level 3 basic linear algebra subprograms for sparse matrices: a user 
level interface
ACM Trans. Math. Softw., 23(3), 379-401, 1997.

In the multilevel preconditioners we use SMMP by Randolph E. Bank and
Craig C. Douglas  na.bank@na-net.ornl.gov and
na.cdouglas@na-net.ornl.gov;  we wrapped  it in a Fortran 95 interface
with dynamic memory allocation. 

INSTALLING

To compile and run our software you will need the following
prerequisites (see also SERIAL below):

1. A working version of MPI

2. The MPI version of the BLACS  from
   http://www.netlib.org/blacs/index.html

3. A version of the BLAS; if you don't have a specific version for
   your platform you may try ATLAS available from
   http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/ 

4. We have had good results with  the METIS library, from 
   http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/metis/main.html 
   This is not necessary to compile our library, but the test program
   in test/Fileread assumes you have it installed.  

To install, choose a Make.inc.XXX file in directory Make that fits
your compilers, modify the paths to libraries to  match your
installation and copy it to Make.inc in the top directory. 
Then run 
 make 
to  compile the library; go to the test directory and its
subdirectories to get test programs done.   


SERIAL: We now provide an (experimental) option to run in serial
	mode. This has only been tested with GCC but it should work
	with the others as well. In serial mode you don't need the
	prereqs 1 and 2 above, and you need to use the -serialmpi
	Make.inc. BEWARE: we only provide a VERY minimal set of fake mpi
	routines that is known to work with our codes; specifically, we
	do not handle a process doing send/receives to itself, neither
	do we handle user defined data types. 

TODO:
Fix all reamining bugs. Bugs? We dont' have any ! ;-)

The PSBLAS team.

In a sister package we are going to provide a library of  multilevel
parallel preconditioners that were developed with the contribution of:  
Pasqua     D'Ambra
Daniela    di Serafino

In that package we will provide interfaces to the following software
packages: 
   --  SuperLU 3.0        http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/
   --  UMFPACK 4.4        http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/ 
These are optional, you only need to install them if you actually want
to use them.  
The MLD2P4 package will be published soon, watch this space!.
